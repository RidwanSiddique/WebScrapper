    cm precision with fast convergence times and high update rates for dynamic
    operation.
  • Integrating the GNSS receiver on the TW5398 with a short, deterministic signal
    path mitigates RF interference that can be induced between the antenna and the
    receiver, both from the external environment as well as high speed busses and
    other noise generators in a host application.  The ZED-X20P digital interface is
    presented to host systems via RS-232 or RS-422, allowing long cable lengths
    immune to noise; alleviating design constaints and promoting plug and play,

  • The AC4990TXF features a precision-tuned, twin circular quad-feed, stacked patch
    element. The signals from the four orthogonal feeds are combined though a feed
    network, amplified in a wideband LNA, then band-split for narrow filtering in
    each band and further amplified prior to recombination at the output. The
    AC4990TXF quad-feed Accutenna® 4 technology enables an excellent axial ratio
    (strongly mitigating multipath) and a tightly grouped phase centre variation (≤

    Ligado signals at 1525 – 1536 MHz can especially impact GNSS antennas that
    support space-based L-band Corrections (1539 – 1559 MHz). New LTE signals in
    Europe [Band 32 (1452 – 1496 MHz)] and Japan [Bands 11 and 21 (1476 – 1511 MHz)]
    have also been observed to interfere with GNSS signals. In addition, Inmarsat
    satellite communication (uplink: 1626.5 – 1660.5 MHz) can also affect GNSS
    signals. The new Calian XF antennas have been designed to mitigate out-of- band
    signals and prevent GNSS antenna saturation. Calian’s custom XF filtering
    mitigates all existing signals and new Ligado and LTE signals, enabling the
    antennas and attached GNSS receivers to perform optimally.
  • The housed AC4990TXF has a rugged through-hole metallic base, and a weatherproof
    enclosure for permanent installations.
