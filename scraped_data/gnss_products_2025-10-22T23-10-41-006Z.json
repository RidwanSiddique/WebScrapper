      "The incorporated GNSS antenna technology is based on the Calian TW3990XF full band Accutenna® antenna.  Calian’s eXtended Filtering  mitigates RF out-of-band signal interference (LTE, WIFI, BT, Ligado) with deep tight filtering around the GNSS bands (to -80 dB). The stacked precision tuned dual-feed ceramic patch increases mult-path resiliency.  The Accutenna patch has linear phase response, tight phase centre variation for better accuracy and excellent axial ratio.",
      "TW5398 incorporates u-blox’s latest generation full-band ZED-X20P GNSS receiver.  TW5398 supports GPS, BeiDou, Galileo satellites plus SBAS, NavIC and QZSS (configurable) across L1/L2/L5/L6 including L-Band.  RTK support attains sub 1 cm precision with fast convergence times and high update rates for dynamic operation.",
      "Integrating the GNSS receiver on the TW5398 with a short, deterministic signal path mitigates RF interference that can be induced between the antenna and the receiver, both from the external environment as well as high speed busses and other noise generators in a host application.  The ZED-X20P digital interface is presented to host systems via RS-232 or RS-422, allowing long cable lengths immune to noise; alleviating design constaints and promoting plug and play, future-proof designs.  Upgrade system PNT capabilities by plugging in a new Smart GNSS antenna solution.",
      "TW5398 has RF interference and jamming detection and reporting features.  Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) anti-spoofing services are also supported as well as spoofing detection and reporting.  TW5398 will support Galileo High Accuracy Service on E6 according to ZED-X20P availability.",

In addition, Inmarsat satellite communication (uplink: 1626.5 – 1660.5 MHz) can also affect GNSS signals. The new Calian XF antennas have been designed to mitigate out-of- band signals and prevent GNSS antenna saturation. Calian’s custom XF filtering mitigates all existing signals and new Ligado and LTE signals, enabling the antennas and attached GNSS receivers to perform optimally.",

      "Part Number: 33-3885TL-xx-yy-zzzz",
      "Calian’s eXtended Filter (XF) antenna technology has been designed to mitigate out-ofband signals and prevent GNSS antenna saturation. The radio frequency spectrum has become more congested as new LTE bands are activated and their signals or harmonic frequencies [e.g. 800MHz x 2 = 1600MHz (GLONASS-G1)] can affect GNSS antennas and receivers. In North America, planned Ligado signals at 1525 – 1536 MHz can especially impact GNSS antennas that support space-based L-band Corrections (1539 – 1559 MHz). New LTE signals in Europe [Band 32 (1452 – 1496 MHz)] and Japan [Bands 11 and 21 (1476 – 1511 MHz)] have also been observed to interfere with GNSS signals. In addition, Inmarsat satellite communication (uplink: 1626.5 – 1660.5 MHz) can also affect GNSS signals. Calian’s custom XF filtering mitigates all existing signals and new Ligado and LTE signals, enabling the antennas and attached GNSS receivers to perform optimally.",
      "The TW3885TL features a precision-tuned, twin circular dual-feed, stacked patch element. The signals from the two orthogonal feeds are combined in a hybrid combiner, amplified in a wideband LNA, then band-split for narrow filtering in each band and further amplified prior to recombination at the output. The TW3885TL offers excellent axial ratio and a tightly grouped phase centre variation.",

      "Weighing only 32 g, the light and compact HC882SXF features the 2nd generation Tallysman precision-tuned helix element that provides excellent axial ratios and operates without the requirement of a ground plane, making it ideal for a wide variety of applications, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The miniaturized 2nd generational helical element is about 25% lighter and 20%(1 cm) shorter than the first generational helical, without compromising on performance such as peak gain at zenith, low roll-off, and bandwidth.",
      "The HC882SXF features an industry-leading low current, low-noise amplifier (LNA) that includes an integrated low-loss pre-filter. eXtended Filtering was added to the HC882 antenna to mitigate new radio frequency bands that interfere with GNSS signals. For example, new LTE bands have been activated, and their signal or harmonic frequencies can affect GNSS antennas and receivers. In North America, the planned Ligado service, which will broadcast in the frequency range of 1526 to 1536 MHz, can affect GNSS antennas that receive space-based L-band correction service signals (1539 – 1559 MHz). Similarly, new LTE signals in Europe [Band 32 (1452 – 1496 MHz)] and Japan [Bands 11 and 21 (1476 – 1511 MHz)] have also affected GNSS signals. Lastly, the Inmarsat satellite communication uplink (1626.5 – 1660.5 MHz), commonly used on maritime vessels, can also affect nearby GNSS antennas.",
      "Field tests have confirmed that Calian’s custom XF technology mitigates the new (Europe and Japan) and existing LTE signals, enabling the XF antenna to produce clean and pure GNSS radio frequency data.",
      "Calian’s 2nd generation housed helical antenna elements are protected by a robust military-grade IP67 plastic enclosure. The enclosure’s base provides two threaded inserts for secure attachment, as well as a rubber O-ring around the outer edge to seal the antenna base and its integrated male SMA connector.",

      "The HC979XF features an industry-leading low current, low-noise amplifier (LNA) that includes an integrated low-loss pre-filter. eXtended Filtering was added to the helical antenna line to mitigate new radio frequency bands that interfere with GNSS signals. For example, new LTE bands have been activated, and their signal or harmonic frequencies can affect GNSS antennas and receivers. In North America, the planned Ligado service, which will broadcast in the frequency range of 1526 to 1536 MHz, can affect GNSS antennas that receive space-based L-band correction service signals (1539 - 1559 MHz). Similarly, new LTE signals in Europe [Band 32 (1452 - 1496 MHz)] and Japan [Bands 11 and 21 (1476 – 1511 MHz)] have also affected GNSS signals. Lastly, the Inmarsat satellite communication uplink (1626.5 - 1660.5 MHz), commonly used on maritime vessels, can also affect nearby GNSS antennas.",
