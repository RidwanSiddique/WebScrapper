    cm precision with fast convergence times and high update rates for dynamic
    operation.
  • Integrating the GNSS receiver on the TW5398 with a short, deterministic signal
    path mitigates RF interference that can be induced between the antenna and the
    receiver, both from the external environment as well as high speed busses and
    other noise generators in a host application.  The ZED-X20P digital interface is
    presented to host systems via RS-232 or RS-422, allowing long cable lengths
    immune to noise; alleviating design constaints and promoting plug and play,

    Ligado signals at 1525 – 1536 MHz can especially impact GNSS antennas that
    support space-based L-band Corrections (1539 – 1559 MHz). New LTE signals in
    Europe [Band 32 (1452 – 1496 MHz)] and Japan [Bands 11 and 21 (1476 – 1511 MHz)]
    have also been observed to interfere with GNSS signals. In addition, Inmarsat
    satellite communication (uplink: 1626.5 – 1660.5 MHz) can also affect GNSS
    signals. The new Calian XF antennas have been designed to mitigate out-of- band
    signals and prevent GNSS antenna saturation. Calian’s custom XF filtering
    mitigates all existing signals and new Ligado and LTE signals, enabling the
    antennas and attached GNSS receivers to perform optimally.
  • The housed AC4990TXF has a rugged through-hole metallic base, and a weatherproof
    enclosure for permanent installations.

DETAILS:
  • Part Number: 33-3885TL-xx-yy-zzzz
  • Calian’s eXtended Filter (XF) antenna technology has been designed to mitigate
    out-ofband signals and prevent GNSS antenna saturation. The radio frequency
    spectrum has become more congested as new LTE bands are activated and their
    signals or harmonic frequencies [e.g. 800MHz x 2 = 1600MHz (GLONASS-G1)] can
    affect GNSS antennas and receivers. In North America, planned Ligado signals at
    1525 – 1536 MHz can especially impact GNSS antennas that support space-based
    L-band Corrections (1539 – 1559 MHz). New LTE signals in Europe [Band 32 (1452 –
    1496 MHz)] and Japan [Bands 11 and 21 (1476 – 1511 MHz)] have also been observed
    to interfere with GNSS signals. In addition, Inmarsat satellite communication
    (uplink: 1626.5 – 1660.5 MHz) can also affect GNSS signals. Calian’s custom XF
    filtering mitigates all existing signals and new Ligado and LTE signals,
    enabling the antennas and attached GNSS receivers to perform optimally.
  • The TW3885TL features a precision-tuned, twin circular dual-feed, stacked patch
    element. The signals from the two orthogonal feeds are combined in a hybrid
    combiner, amplified in a wideband LNA, then band-split for narrow filtering in
    each band and further amplified prior to recombination at the output. The
    TW3885TL offers excellent axial ratio and a tightly grouped phase centre
    variation.
  • Ideal for timing, the TW3885TL provides superior multipath signal rejection, a
    linear phase response, and tight phase centre variation (PCV). In addition, a
    built-in lightning arrestor provides output protection from lightning transients
    and surges up to 5 kA over 8/20 μs.
  • The TW3885TL is housed in a through-hole mount, weatherproof enclosure for
    permanent installations. L-bracket (PN 23-0040-0) or pipe mount (23-0065-0) are
    available. A 100-mm ground plane is provided for all installations.

DETAILS:
  • The ARM990XF antenna is available in two form factors one includes a 100 mm
    integrated ground plane, weighing 140 g, and the other one is 83mm in diameter
    and weighs 138 grams. Both are 19 mm tall and support the ARINC mini bolt
    pattern of 2.0” x 1.66”. Calian's ARM990XF is one of the smallest and lightest
    housed triple-band precision Mini ARINC GNSS antennas on the market. It has a
    very tight average phase center variation of less than 10 mm for all frequencies
    and overall azimuths and elevation angles. In addition to supporting two form
    factors both models are available with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) qualified
    components.
  • Housed in a weatherproof enclosure, the ARM990XF is available in four versions.
    Model ARM990XF-1 has an integrated 100mm ground plane, Model ARM990XF-2 is 83 mm
    in diameter. All models are available with either a female SMA or TNC connector.
  • The new ARM990XF antenna supports Calian's eXtended Filtering (XF) technology.
