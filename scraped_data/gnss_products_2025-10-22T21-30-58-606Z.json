    "description": "The TW5398 is a multi-band (L1/L2/L5/L6), multi-constellation integrated GNSS receiver/antenna with RTK PointPerfect®-Flex (PPP-RTK) and PP-Global (PPP) augmentaion compatibility. The TW5398 is capable of providing sub 1.2 meter accuracy stand-alone, sub 10 cm accuracy with PPP, sub 6 cm accuracy with PPP-RTK and sub 1 cm with RTK corrections (commercial or local). TW5398 also authenticates Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) anti-spoofing messages. TW5398 can be configured to act as a base or rover for RTK operation. The incorporated GNSS antenna technology is based on the Calian TW3990XF full band Accutenna® antenna.  Calian’s eXtended Filtering  mitigates RF out-of-band signal interference (LTE, WIFI, BT, Ligado) with deep tight filtering around the GNSS bands (to -80 dB). The stacked precision tuned dual-feed ceramic patch increases mult-path resiliency.  The Accutenna patch has linear phase response, tight phase centre variation for better accuracy and e",
